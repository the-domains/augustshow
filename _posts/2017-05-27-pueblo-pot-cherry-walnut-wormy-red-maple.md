**[Steve Germaine][0] -Fort Collins, Colorado, 2017**

"I make art because I have a desire to create something that when viewed elicits an emotional response"

"A hope of contributing a little something beautiful now and then, and to be a supply-side participant in the trans formative power of art."

Steve's art is made using wood because wood and forests have been integral part of his . He grew up in the hardwood forests of New England, and began making wooden things at a young age, spent his career studying forest ecology, and returned to the forests for nourishment, inspiration, and recreation.
