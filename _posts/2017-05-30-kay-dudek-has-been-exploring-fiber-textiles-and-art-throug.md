  Kay Dudek has been exploring fiber, textiles, and art throughout her life. A
  few years ago, however, she discovered felting as an art form. The medium and
  techniques struck a chord, and felting became a passion. As a medium, fiber is
  tactile, versatile, and often surprising. Kay uses it to create soft pottery
  and sculpture, much like clay. She also blends dyed fiber to produce shades
  and tones for felt “paintings”.

Much of her inspiration comes from the natural world and draws from her training and work in science. At other times, however, inspiration emanates from a darker place that reflects her reactions to unexpected and frustrating turns her life has taken.The creative process and the physical nature of felting provide an outlet for expressing emotions that are difficult to convey.
