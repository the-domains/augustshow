Cherry, Walnut, Wormy Red Maple">,<p>Steve’s art is made using wood because wood and forests have been integral part of his . He grew up in the hardwood forests of New England, and began making wooden things at a young age, spent his career studying forest ecology, and returned to the forests for nourishment, inspiration, and recreation.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Spiritual Surrender by Patty Hughes]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Patty Hughes</p>,<p>"I am a self taught artist who has been drawing and painting for about 20 years. I have attended many workshops by outstanding instructors, and I have won awards for my work over the years. I work mostly in watercolor, acrylic, collage and mixed media and enjoy creating abstract and non-objective pieces. Since I started painting late in life, I was not sure of my purpose, but felt the strong pull to discover what I was meant to create.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/164af83f-fefb-466f-a4d8-776981e53632.jpg">,<p>What a journey it has been and continues to be!! Much of my work is intuitive, discovering where I am going in a painting as I travel through the process. Some of my work is deliberate, perhaps a mixed media piece of an incredible mountain scene or an abstract representation of a raptor in flight. My love of nature and my surroundings is evident in my plein air pieces along with my work done in the studio. I hope that my work evokes emotion when the resulting product is revealed. I love to share the gift I have been given with others!"</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/023336c4-7470-42cd-badd-19ba7d35d944.png">]]></description>
